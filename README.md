Module 3: React
Assignment: Knowledge Check - Bootstrap Basics, Utilities, Forms, and Components

Project Requirements:

1. Form Creation and Layout:
    - Use Bootstrap’s form components to create a registration form with fields for First Name, Last Name, Email, Password, and a checkbox for agreeing        to terms.
    - Apply Bootstrap grid layout to position the First Name and Last Name fields side-by-side.
    - Use validation classes to ensure the Email and Password fields are required.
    - Add a submit button styled with btn-success.
2. Table for Displaying Data:
    - Create a Bootstrap table to display user data.
    - Hard-code sample data into the table to simulate user submissions.
    - Apply striped and hoverable rows to enhance readability.
    - Make the table responsive by wrapping it in a table-responsive div.
3. Image and Button Utilities:
    - Add a responsive image using the img-fluid class and place it inside a fluid container to stretch across the page.
    - Below the main image, add a circular image (rounded-circle).
    - Create two buttons:
      -- One button should be visible on all screen sizes.
      -- The second button should be hidden on small screens using responsive utilities (d-none and d-md-block).
4. Responsive Navigation Bar:
    - Build a navbar with links to Home, About, and Contact sections.
    - Ensure the navbar collapses into a hamburger menu on smaller screens.
    - Use Bootstrap utilities and components to style the navbar.
5. Responsiveness and Layout:
    - Use Bootstrap containers (container or container-fluid) to structure the layout.
    - Ensure that all components are responsive across different screen sizes using media queries and Bootstrap utilities.
